# Robotic Flower - Machine Learning / Art Interactive Project :tulip:

This is a robotic flower that wilts :skull: or blooms :cherry_blossom: depending on smile detection :smiley: using a Haar-Cascade alogrithm that works well with facial detection. This is a machine learning and art interactive project under the Halicioglu Data Science Institute (HDSI) and the Institute for Learning-Enabled Optimization at Scale (TILOS). We hope this is a project enjoyable for all to interact with!

# How Does It Work?

The concept of the project is fairly simple - honestly straightfoward - you look at

# Requirements (if you want to have your own robotic flower):
### Hardware
1. Raspberry Pi 3 Board or Above
2. Raspberry Pi Camera V2 or Above
3. HiWonder xArm 1S** (any other robotic arm might not translate well with the code due to constraints and limitations of different robotic arms)
4. Monitor (of any kind that display output)
5. Mouse and Keyboard (optional)
6. USB Micro B Cable (to connect xArm to Raspberry Pi)

### Required Libraries/Frameworks
1. Python <br>
``pip install python`` OR <br>
``pip install python3`` (dependent on your OS)
3.  OpenCV <br>
``pip install opencv-python``
