# Robotic Flower - Machine Learning / Art Interactive Project :tulip:

This is a robotic flower that wilts :skull: or blooms :cherry_blossom: depending on smile detection :smiley: using a Haar-Cascade alogrithm that works well with facial detection. This is a machine learning and art interactive project under the Halicioglu Data Science Institute (HDSI) and the Institute for Learning-Enabled Optimization at Scale (TILOS). We hope this is a project enjoyable for all to interact with!
